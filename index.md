Hey there! I'm a kernel developer and SRE, primarily working on Linux memory
management. I work at [Meta](https://meta.com) as part of the Linux Kernel
team, and am responsible for improving the overall reliability and performance
of user-facing products from an infrastructure perspective. In general, my
drive is in conceiving, designing, and improving systems that make Meta and the
wider industry better.

Most of my active work revolves around making operating systems more efficient
at scale, developing things like [the Linux
kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits?author=cdown),
[cgroups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZ8_mRotT4),
[systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd), and a number of other emerging
technologies.

Outside of that, I dabble in
[photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisdown/albums/72157711447135721?layout=justified)
and [sim racing](/racing.html).
